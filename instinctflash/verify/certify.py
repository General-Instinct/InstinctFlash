"""Certification: paired non-inferiority on task success.

WHY THIS IS NOT `probe_bitexact`

Every gate in this project so far asks `max|delta action| == 0`. That is the right question for a
runtime pass and a meaningless one for a model-level optimization: a distilled student produces
different actions by construction. The question becomes statistical -- *is the student's task
success acceptably close to the teacher's* -- and statistical questions are easy to answer
dishonestly.

Three rules, each of which exists because the obvious alternative is wrong:

1. **PAIRED.** The same episodes, same seeds, teacher and student. Two independent 2500-episode
   runs would let ordinary between-run variance masquerade as a real difference; pairing removes
   it. The test is McNemar on the discordant pairs, which is the correct test for paired binary
   outcomes and ignores episodes where both arms agree.

2. **THE MARGIN IS DECLARED BEFORE THE RUN.** `certify()` requires `margin` as an argument and
   records it in the certificate. A threshold chosen after seeing the delta is not a gate, it is a
   narrative. This is the same discipline that made the equivalence tiers useful.

3. **IT CAN FAIL.** A certificate that only ever says yes is decoration. The verdict is
   non-inferiority at the declared margin, and `FAIL` is a normal outcome that should block a
   release.

Incomplete or unpaired inputs are refused outright rather than partially analysed, matching
`aggregate.py`'s `REPORTABLE: NO`.

TWO INTERVAL METHODS, EXPLICITLY NAMED — a migration note (2026-08-27, PR #4 port):

* ``interval="wald_central95"`` (the default, and the only method that ever existed here):
  ``ci95`` is the paired Wald central 95% interval, the decision rule is its lower bound, and
  the serialized certificate is byte-identical to every certificate this module has stamped
  before the port. Nothing about the default flow changed; re-stamping prior outcomes (verified
  on the VA 2V/4A pooled run) reproduces the old block exactly.
* ``interval="tango_one_sided95"`` (opt-in; the preregistered pi0.5 TF32 closed-loop gate):
  the decision is Tango's matched-pair score ONE-SIDED 95% lower confidence bound
  (z=1.6448536269514722), which stays non-degenerate at zero discordance where Wald collapses
  to [0, 0]. The two one-sided bounds land in their own explicitly named field
  ``tango_central90`` — named for what the pair IS (a central 90% interval), never serialized
  as ``ci95`` — alongside ``lower_confidence_bound``/``ci_method``/``p_value_kind``. ``ci95``
  keeps its Wald meaning in both modes. The exact McNemar p is descriptive in this mode and
  never decides non-inferiority.

The PR that brought Tango silently rebound the ``ci95`` field to the central-90 pair and made
z=1.6449 the default for every family's stamp flow; this port keeps the repo-wide certificate
stable and makes the new rule a deliberate, named choice per certificate.
